To use StdLib, you’ll want Node.js version 6.9.x or higher installed from the Official Node.js Website. 
Once complete, open up your Terminal or Command Line and install the StdLib Command Line Tools with the following:
$ npm install lib.cli -g
This gives you access to the lib command for service management and execution. Next, create a stdlib directory for your StdLib services.
$ mkdir stdlib
$ cd stdlib
$ lib init
You’ll be asked to log in using the credentials you created your account with. That’s it!
