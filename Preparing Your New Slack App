Preparing Your New Slack App
First, make sure you’re signed in to Slack. Next, visit your Slack Apps page at https://api.slack.com/apps. You’ll see a screen that looks like the following, though you may not have any existing apps yet.

Click “Create New App”
Simply click Create New App to create your app. You’ll be presented with a modal to enter in your App Name (I recommend “Test App” for the purposes of this tutorial) and the Development Slack Team you’d like to add it to.

From here, click Create App and you’ll find yourself on a Basic Information page. Keep this page open in your browser, we’ll be using it in a second.
