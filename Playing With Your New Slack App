Playing With Your New Slack App
You’re all done. Try it out! Your Slack App is now available for use in the Slack Team you authorized it for. By default, “Test App” should respond to a /hello command and to the regex pattern /hi|hello|sup|hey/ in normal channel messages. It will also welcome members when they join channels.

Test App in Action!
You can modify these behaviors in your StdLib service directory at functions/commands/hello.js, functions/events/message/__main__.js, and functions/events/message/channel_join.js. You can even create your own event responses and commands — just make sure for Slash Commands that you enable them via the Slack App management portal and your app has the correct permissions.
You can also Enable Distribution for this app and share it with other people by linking them to https://<username>.lib.id/slack-app@dev/, but we recommend creating a separate Slack App for this purpose and using lib release (so you don’t need the @dev qualifier). Full documentation for the StdLib command line tools is available on GitHub.
That’s it! Your Slack App is live!

Thanks for reading, and we hope we’ve been helpful showing you how easy it is to create a Slack App using Standard Library! Feel free to dig around in the template-generated codebase and make modifications or add new features. If there’s something you think the slack template is missing, it’s available open source at https://github.com/stdlib/utils.templates under the templates/slack directory. We welcome contributions and bugfixes!
